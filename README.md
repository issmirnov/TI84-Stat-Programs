# TI84 Statistics Programs [v1.0]
***


This is a collection of various programs that can solve statistical problems on a TI-84 calculator.


### Installation

These scripts can be loaded on a TI-84 calculator through a companion app, downloadable from the Texas Instruments site.

### Usage

*Note:* Please check with your instructor if you are allowed to use these programs. When I wrote them, I showed them to my instructor and asked for permission, which she explicitly granted. Please, do not cheat on exams.

#### BIFINDN
 - asks for p, CL, Error,
 - outputs minimum n required
 
#### CONFINT
 - uses first formula on sheet (see my study guide repo)
 - input what you know (N, sigma, CL,)
 - output margin of error, stored to M
 
#### CONFP
 - uses third formula on sheet
 - input what you know (N, p, CL,)
 - output margin of error, stored to M
 
#### CONFT
 - uses second formula on sheet
 - input what you know (N, sx, CL,)
 - output margin of erro, stored to M
 
#### INVT
 - subfunction, used bt invtC
 
#### INVTC
 - input (CL, DF)
 - output T, stored to T
 
#### PPCONFINT
 - input N1, P1, N2, P2, CL
 - output lower and upper limits of confidence interval
 - stores to L and U, resepectively
 
#### QUADSOLV
 - input A, B, C of a quadratic
 - solves for X
 
#### STATNORM
 - input X, mean, sigma, and N
 - output area above and below X (probabilities)
 
#### TEZ 
 - subfunction, outputs area above and below current Z value
 
#### Z-SIDE
 - prompts for Z, runes TEZ

#### ZZ
 - asks for known Z and area, outputs other Z values (2 options) 


### FAQ

> How and why did you write these programs?

I was bored in my statistics class, and wanted to program. Incidentally, these programs also earned me an A in the class.
